# ISELab Debugger

This project is something I am doing as an independent study project under 
Dr. Julie Rursch in the fall of 2020 at Iowa State University. 

In general, this is intended to be a tool for people new to network management
or the more complex ISELAB environment to understand what is happening on their
networks. It is deisgned to work in an ISELab, a product of the [ISEAGE research 
lab](https://iseage.org), who I worked for from my junior through super-senior years
at Iowa State.
