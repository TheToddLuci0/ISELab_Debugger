The project would create a traffic visualization framework that provides students new to networking and cyber security a
contextual way to comprehend what is occurring during laboratory experiments.  It could also be used during
demonstrations to help them solidify concepts we learn from reading packets, looking at protocols, and looking at
malformed packets.  The product will be produced using the Internet Scale Event and Attack Environment (ISEAGE) testbed
as it is implemented in ISELab for classes at Iowa State University.

The framework developed shall have a number of distinct goals.

First, the project will provide a simple graphical means for students to see the traffic entering and existing their
networks. Ideally, there will be some basic level of categorization.

Second, the project will show potential attack traffic. This may include a threshold of specific types of traffic that
provide alerts.

Third, there will be functionality for the verification of the status of services hosted by students as part of lab
activities.

Fourth, the project will provide some means of easy extension, for ease of the introduction of further analysis and
service testing tools.

Finally, the project will be easily deployed by those without extensive knowledge of systems administration.
