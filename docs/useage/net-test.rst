Network Test
============

This provides a way to test your network configuration. This is really only useful in an ISELab or ISEAGE CDC
environment, as it makes a number of assumptions about what different errors might mean.

The default values for an ISELab are as follows:

- Proxy: ``199.100.16.100:3128``
- Gateway: ``.254`` of your range
- Test Site: For this, use any site you can reasonably expect to be alive.
